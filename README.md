# Compiling and Running

To run the project first navigate to the Java-Chess/src directory in a terminal or command line. The "Chess.class" file should already be in this directory. If it is not, compile the project using:

```

```

Once compiled (make sure the "Chess.class" file exists in your working directory), enter:
```
java Chess
```
