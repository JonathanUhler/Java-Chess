If the issue has something to do with chess rules, please include the FEN position (the string of characters in the textbox at the top of the program) here. If the issue is something else, leave this blank

**Context**
Please describe the issue is in as much detail as possible (what piece can/cannot make a move it shouldn't/should be able to? what is wrong with the program? etc). If possible, please also describe how to reproduce the bug.

**Expected Behavior**
Please explain what you think the expected behavior should be; what should the program do if there was no bug? (this will be especially helpful if the issue is not extremely obvious to notice or does not have something to do with chess rules).

Please include the machine and operating system used to produce the issue.
